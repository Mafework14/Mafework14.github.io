    <li><a href="https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/"> Good-ESPN Fantasy Football</a></li>
    <p>I think this fantasy football website that ESPN has put together is well put together and has a well organized user interface. Looking at the code of the website it does look like it's more modern and up to date. I have also been playing fantasy football for a long time through ESPN and they always do a good job of keeping their format up to date and modernizing their website to appeal to their users. I think another aspect is that there seems to be a really good balance between information both to click on and to read, and organized tabs that you can look into. The other thing ESPN does well here is they start with much more generic information that is for all fantasy football players and then they have a tab that gives you a more customized experience which can be looked into by clicking on tabs that go into your specific league or team and can give you more information that pertains to you and your experience. Color wise, I think the website does a good job staying basic and staying with a consistent theme throughout the website so that there isn't much of a distraction and it doesn't take away from the images that ESPN uses to lure users into their articles and information they are trying to portray to their following. Also, the scoreboard listed at the top of the page indicates a knowledge of the demographic that ESPN is looking at tailoring their experience to and doesn't distract from the website, but at the same, it gives some extra information if one is interested and if that appeals to the user. The website is easily navigable with the options on how to go deeper into the website and get the information you want pretty clear and accessible. Overall I think this website achieves the experience it wants and gives us a good idea on how to make something both functional, and visually appealing.   </p>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Good-Apple</a></li>
     <p>This apple website is great as expected in my opinion. They displayed what their brand is on their website very well. When I think of Apple I think of sleek, futuristic, modern, and this is exactly what I see on their website. Just on the first glance of the page we see their most recent product on the market. The way that you can scroll through their selling points on the front page I like a lot as it goes from the Iphone 13, to the macbook pro, into the airpods. I think they do a great job of serving what the apple customer wants to see. The numerous tabs on the top are well placed without taking too much attention away from their products that they are trying to sell on the main page. The colors, font and sizes I thought were greatly placed and displayed the apple brand perfectly.</p>
     <li><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Bad-Berkshire Hathaway</a></<li>
       <p> Berkshire Hathaway's Website</> was frankly quite disturbing when I opened the website for the first time. The homepage has little to no design, and although the efficiency is there in the website, there is nothing that is eye catching whatsoever. This site’s code is pretty simple, as if it probably hasn’t been updated much with new features since the 1990s. They are using HTML5 elements and it does validate. The format is functional, which was obviously the goal of the designers. There is no scrolling effect because the page is so concise that all the information and links that lead to necessary information are in front of you when you first get onto the page. This makes navigation swift, as you can really get anywhere necessary within 2 clicks. The site uses colors to almost no extent, as the background is straight white, and the only other colors on the page are the hyperlinks in the main table.</p>
