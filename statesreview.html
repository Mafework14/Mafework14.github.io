<h1>Review Of States</h1>

<h2>My Rankings:</h2>

<h3>My Top Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska</a>

<p>I enjoyed Nebraska's website because they had the most pleasing colors out of the other four websites I looked at.
  The website is not overly flashy. I had no problems finding any information, the website was quick to load and very easy to navigate.
  The background of the front page was a beautiful picture of the city. The website also displayed a colorful graph with solid information.
</p>


<h3>My Second Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">Illinois</a>

<p>Illinois is my second favorite website that I viewed.They displayed the most creative website.
  In the middle of the page they have a “Illinois Virtual Assistant.” I used it and it was very helpful guiding me through the website with ease.
  This website also has a lot of helpful information about the state and what they are about.
</p>

<h3>My Third Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Florida</a>

<p>Florida was my third favorite website. Their homepage is an exquisite picture of a sunset.
  They have a search bar where someone can ask whatever they want.
  However the page did not display a lot of information. Besides the sunset picture, the website was simple.
</p>


<h3>My Fourth Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a>

<p>Alaska had a ton of information on their website. They had different dropdowns and links.
  The website was somewhat overwhelming. The colors were not very eye-pleasing and there was not a ton of pictures.
</p>


<h3>My Last Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://delaware.gov/">Delaware</a>

<p>Delaware was my least favorite website out of the five I had the chance to analyze.
  I feel like this website had too much information about covid-19.
  The website's first two pages are all information about covid with alerts and cautions. The website's colors were the least eye pleasing.
